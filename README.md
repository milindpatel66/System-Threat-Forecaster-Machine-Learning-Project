System-Threat-Forecaster-Machine-Learning-Project

Tech stack: Scikit learn and pandas

The goal of the System Threat Forecaster is to predict the probability of a system getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software. They contain the target that indicates whether the system is infected (1) or not infected(0). Early detection of malware infections can help prevent security breaches.

Aim: To use the training data (train.csv) to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the probability of malware infection for each machine in the test set (test.csv), learn attack patterns and help in early detection. The approach focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve the highest predictive performance.
